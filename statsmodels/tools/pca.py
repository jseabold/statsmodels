    Principal Components Analysis

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like
        2d array-like variable with variables in columns
    on : str {'corr', 'cov'}, optonal
        Perform PCA on correlation ('corr') or covariance ('cov')
    norm : bool, optional
        False - Principal components are normed to 1
        True - Principal components are normed to the associated eigenvalues
    method : str {'eig', 'svd'}, optional
        'eig' - compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors directly
        'svd' - compute via the singular value decomposition
    ddof : int
        The degrees of freedom correction for the correlation or covariance
        calculation. Result is normalized by (N - ddof) where N is the number
        of observations.
