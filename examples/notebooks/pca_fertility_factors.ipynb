      "In this notebook, we use principal components analysis (PCA) to analyze the time series of fertility rates in 192 countries, using data obtained from the World Bank.  The main goal is to understand how the trends in fertility over time differ from country to country.  This is a slightly atypical illustration of PCA because the data are time series.  Methods such as functional PCA have been developed for this setting, but since the fertility data are very smooth, there is no real disadvantage to using standard PCA in this case."
